text=<p>The story so far:</p>
<p>In the beginning the Universe was created.</p>
<p>This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. </p>
<p>Many races believe that it was created by some sort of God, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI believe that the entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure. </p>
<p>The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they call The Coming of The Great White Handkerchief, are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel. </p>
<p>However, the Great Green Arkleseizure Theory is not widely accepted outside Viltvodle VI and so, the Universe being the puzzling place it is, other explanations are constantly being sought. </p>
<p>For instance, a race of hyperintelligent pan dimensional beings once built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep Thought to calculate once and for all the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. </p>
<p>For seven and a half million years, Deep Thought computed and calculated, and in the end announced that the answer was in fact Forty two and so another, even bigger, computer had to be built to find out what the actual question was. </p>
<p>And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large that it was frequently mistaken for a planete - specially by the strange ape like beings who roamed its surface, totally unaware that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program. </p>
<p>And this is very odd, because without that fairly simple and obvious piece of knowledge, nothing that ever happened on the Earth could possibly make the slightest bit of sense. </p>
<p>Sadly however, just before the critical moment of readout, the Earth was unexpectedly demolished by the Vogons to make way so they claimedfor a new hyperspace bypass, and so all hope of discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever.</p>
<p>Or so it would seem.</p>
